# VSC LAZY GOTO

An extension to provide a slightly modified goto command (typically the ctrl + g shortcut) in Visual Studio Code.

The modified behaviour is displaying the target location only after the user submits their desired line number (e.g., enters line numner then presses enter).
Typically goto would be eager, without pressing enter, the editor would present the desired line number.

* Moving the cursor whilst updating a selected area is also supported
